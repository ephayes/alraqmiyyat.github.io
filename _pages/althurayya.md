# [https://althurayya.github.io/](https://althurayya.github.io/)

Our new working version of *al-Ṯurayyā Gazetteer* (or *al-Thurayyā Gazetteer*) it includes over 2,000 toponyms and almost as many route sections georeferenced from Georgette Cornu’s *Atlas du monde arabo-islamique à l'époque classique: IXe-Xe siècles* (Leiden: Brill, 1983).  The functionality is still under development. You can use an earlier version of *al-Ṯurayyā*, where you can browse the Gazetteer by clicking on any toponym marker. The popup will show the toponym both in Arabic script and transliterated. We are using a slightly modified transliteration system that facilitates conversion between fully transliterated, transliterated, and Arabic forms of toponyms. It should be easily understandable. There may be typos, because of the nature of how the data has been generated, so please, let us know if something should be corrected. The popup also offers a selection of possible sources on a toponym in question. You can check *Arabic Sources*: currently, al-Samʿānī’s *Kitāb al-ansāb* and Yāqūt’s *Muʿjam al-buldān*. Currently, the Gazetteer will only check for exact matches, which means that in some cases there will not be any entry at all, while in other cases there may be more than one and they may refer to other places with the same name. Improving the precision of this lookup is on our to-do list. You can also check if there is information on a toponym in question in Brill’s *Encyclopaedia of Islam*, *Pleiades*, and *Wikipedia*. It can be found [here](https://althurayya.github.io/previous/althurayya_02/).

*Note on transliteration:* The website uses a somewhat unconventional transliteration system, which was developed to facilitate computational analysis. Unlike more traditional transliteration schemes the current one uses one-to-one letter representation, with every Arabic letter transcribed distinctively, which allows for an automatic conversion between transliteration and the Arabic script. The overall scheme should be easily recognizable to Arabists (new letters are as follows: *ŧ* for *tāʾ marbuṭaŧ*; *ã* for dagger *alif*; and *á* for *alif maqṣūraŧ*).
