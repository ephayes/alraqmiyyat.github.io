excerpt:	"The written Arabic heritage is as vast as it is understudied and underrepresented in the digital humanities. The sheer volume and diversity of the surviving works produced in Arabic in the premodern period makes this body of texts ideal for computational forms of analysis. Efforts to utilize these new digital forms of analysis, however, have been stymied by the lack of a reliable corpus. **OpenArabic** is an effort within the Alexander von Humboldt Chair for Digital Humanities (Leipzig University) to create the first machine-actionable scholarly corpus of premodern Arabic texts."

You can find the latest report on the development of **OpenArabic** at the status page of the project: [github.com/OpenArabic/Annotation](https://github.com/OpenArabic/Annotation). 

**OpenArabic** is also a part of the *Open Islamicate Texts Initiative* (**OpenITI**, see [iti-corpus.github.io/](http://iti-corpus.github.io/)), which is a multi-institutional effort to construct the first machine-actionable scholarly corpus of premodern Islamicate texts. Led by researchers at the Aga Khan University (AKU), Leipzig University (LU), and the Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland (College Park) and an interdisciplinary advisory board of leading digital humanists and Islamic, Persian, and Arabic studies scholars, **OpenITI** aims to provide the essential textual infrastructure in Persian and Arabic for new forms of macro textual analysis and digital scholarship. In the process, ITI will enable new synergies between Digital Humanities and the inter-related Islamicate fields of Islamic, Persian, and Arabic Studies.
