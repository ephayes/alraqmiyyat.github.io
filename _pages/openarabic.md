excerpt:	"The main goal of **OpenArabic mARkdown** is to provide a simple system for tagging structural elements in premodern and early modern Arabic texts that are being prepared within the framework of the [OpenArabic Project](https://github.com/OpenArabic). The use of **OpenArabic mARkdown** will allow one to engage in the computational analysis of classical Arabic texts in the same way as more complex and time-consuming tagging schemes (like TEI XML); **OpenArabic mARkdown** will also facilitate the conversion of the large volume of Arabic texts into TEI XML, which is now the standard format for digital editions. In principle, **OpenArabic mARkdown** does not require any special editor, but the current implementation relies on EditPad Pro, which supports right-to-left languages, Unicode, and large files. However, it is the support of custom highlighting and navigation schemes that makes this text editor particularly convenient for **OpenArabic mARkdown**."
